## What is the RaaS&reg; API?

With our RaaS API you can elegantly knit a sophisticated rewards program into your platform. Create an account, fund an account, manage catalog, send rewards, and get order history - all available on demand, real time, and as a service.

## Test drive the RaaS API

You can test drive the RaaS API without writing a single line of code!  

Using the [RaaS API Test Console](https://integration-www.tangocard.com/raas_api_console/), you can easily go through each resource supported our API and see the requests and the responses for each of these resources. When you are comfortable with the concepts you can begin coding by requesting Sandbox credentials for our test site. Then, if you run into problems during the coding phase you can come back to our console and compare your JSON to our requests and responses to see what is different.


## Sandbox credentials

Please email sdk@tangocard.com to receive credentials for the RaaS API Sandbox environment. 
The endpoint for the RESTful interface on the Sandbox environment is https://sandbox.tangocard.com/raas/v1/

An important note about *Test Codes*: Rewards delivered from Tango Card's Sandbox environment contain sample codes and have no monetary or reemable value. Additionally, please note that some Amazon.com denominations, like $20, may fail in the Sandbox environment. This is intentional behavior for the purpose of simulating an API error. If you encounter an error when testing an Amazon.com code, please try another denomination. Be assured that Amazon.com orders work consistently in the production environment. 

When you have completed your development and are ready for production testing / launch you can request production credentials.


## Production credentials

Once you are ready to move to production, you need to agree to the [RaaS API Terms & Conditions](https://creator.zoho.com/shighet/raas-api-agreement/form-perma/RaaS_API_Agreement/U12njtAWxArN6VnavC92RTZkw2kUOQhbkZxKsKD0jHAOqFwxvQRSQKfU2xW8xytQuMPHUafDD3P0vnsXVKDYAjOOR3qHOdq7kQHr/). 
Once you agree to the Terms & Conditions, we will create credentials on the Production environment and follow up with you. 
The endpoint for the RESTful interface on the Production environment is https://api.tangocard.com/raas/v1/


## RaaS API credentials versus TangoCard.com user credentials

Our now-depricated legacy SDKs used username and password credentials (like those used for user accounts on our website). If you are upgrading to the RaaS API from one of our legacy SDKs, please note that our RaaS API uses a Platform Name and Platform Key that need to be created for your RaaS API account and you can not mix the credentials for TangoCard.com site with the credentials for the RaaS API.


## System-wide Notes

* [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is the only currently-supported content type for inputs or outputs. It is not required that the requests contain an Accept header, but if they do it should contain "application/json" or "*/*.
* All calls require the platform's authentication. Authentication uses [HTTP Basic auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) with the platform name as the username and the platform access key as the password. These will be assigned by Tango Card.
* All dates will/must be represented in a format that is compatible with [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (for example: *2013-02-21T20:37:07-07:00*).
* Platform will be responsible for handling access to it's accounts (e.g. not allowing ACC1 to place an order using ACC2's account)... requests from authenticated platforms against their accounts will be implicitly trusted.
* Whenever money is concerned, it is in cents (e.g. $4 = 400).
* Fields in the RaaS API response objects may be added at any time. This means that whatever is used to demarshall the JSON responses into native data types needs to be able to handle unknown fields without failing.
* All responses may include a `system_message` field. This is a note from TangoCard to the platforms and not intended for end users. This will notify of things like planned outages and should be monitored.


## SSL/TLS

All communication with Tango Card's RaaS API is handled over SSL, a commonly-used protocol for managing secured message transmissions on the Internet. As a result, clients of the RaaS API need to ensure that you have the [chain (intermediate) certificate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_certificate_authorities) in place on your server. This is important as not having the chain certificate in place will (at best) disallow communication or (at worst) expose you to the potential for [man-in-the-middle attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). To accomplish this, we recommend you add the CA's cert to your system's trusted list. If that's not possible, an alternative is to include the certificate in your application. Major CAs deliver a ‘bundled’ file containing the complete certificate chain providing a single installation method for the certificate.
 
The Certificate Authority that issued our server certificates is [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/), and we have one of their *DigiCert SHA2 Secure Server CA* certs. You can get DigiCert's root and intermediate certificates from [https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm](https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm).  If you choose to reference the certificate chain from your application's code, the details on how to do this are highly specific to the library being used to make the connection, but here are a few examples to demonstrate the idea:
 
 ```ruby
 # Ruby (using net/https)
 https = Net::HTTP.new('integration-api.tangocard.com', 443) 
 https.use_ssl = true 
 https.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER 
 https.ca_file = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "../ca_certs/digicert_chain.pem") 
 https.request_get('/fake/example')
 ```
 
 ```PHP
 # PHP (using curl)
 $curl = curl_init('https://integration-api.tangocard.com/fake/example');
 curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, true);
 curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_CAINFO, __DIR__ . "../ca_certs/digicert_chain.pem");
 curl_exec($curl);
 ```
 
 ```python
 # python (using requests)
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
# SSL is used by default.
requests.get('https://integration-api.tangocard.com/fake/example',
             auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password))
```

One thing to take note of in both examples is that OpenSSL is being instructed to **VERIFY PEER**. This setting is essential as without it you will know that your communication is encrypted, but you won't know who it is you're talking to.
 
Note: We use a wild-card certificate from DigiCert and hence the certificate chain is the same for both Sandbox and Production environments.
 


# Resources


## Account Resources

The following is a section of resources related to the platform's accounts.

* An "account identifier" in the system can be whatever is convenient for the platform as long as it adheres to the following rules:
 * Between 5 and 96 characters in length (inclusive).
 * Must be made up exclusively of: alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), underscore (_), dash (-), or plus (+).
 * Must be unique to the platform.
* A "customer" is a mechanism for denoting a company, department, etc an account belongs to. 



### Create a new platform account.

POST /raas/v1/accounts

The input object is defined by [this JSON-Schema](account_create.schema.json).

	>
	{
		"identifier": "123456",
		"email"     : "demo@example.com",
		"customer"  : "CompanyA"
	}


	< HTTP/1.1 201 Created
	< Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	< Location: https://integration-api.tangocard.com/raas/v1/accounts/123456
	< Content-Length: 118
	< 
	{
		"success": true,
		"account": {
			"identifier"       : "123456",
			"email"            : "demo@example.com",
			"customer"         : "CompanyA",
			"available_balance": 0
		}
	}





### Get the information for a specific platform account.

GET /raas/v1/accounts/{customer}/{account_identifier}

Example request/response:

	> GET /raas/v1/accounts/CompanyA/123456 HTTP/1.1
	> Authorization: Basic C0FFEEC0FFEEC0FFEEC0FFEE
	> Host: integration-api.tangocard.com

		"success": true,
		"account": {
			"identifier"       : "123456",
			"email"            : "demo@example.com",
			"customer"         : "CompanyA",
			"available_balance": 0
		}
	}



## Fund Resources


### Register a credit card to an account.

POST /raas/v1/cc_register

The input object is defined by [the cc_register JSON-Schema](cc_register.schema.json).

Example request/response:

	> POST /raas/v1/cc_register HTTP/1.1
	> Authorization: Basic ...
	> Host: integration-api.tangocard.com
	> Accept: */*
	> Content-Length: ...
	> Content-Type: application/json
	> 
	{
	  "customer": "CompanyA",
	  "account_identifier": "123456",
	  "client_ip": "55.44.33.22",
	  "credit_card": {
	    "number": "4111111111111111",
	    "security_code": "123",
	    "expiration": "2016-11",
	    "billing_address": {
	      "f_name": "John",
	      "l_name": "Doe",
	      "address": "1234 Fake St",
	      "city": "Springfield",
	      "state": "WA",
	      "zip": "99196",
	      "country": "USA",
	      "email": "test@example.com"
	    }
	  }
	}
	
	< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	< Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	< Content-Length: ...
	<
	{
      "success": true,
      "cc_token": "152686945",
      "active_date": 1405444573
	}
	
- cc_token represents your payment method and cannot be retrieved later, *DO NOT LOSE IT*. 
- active_date is a unix timestamp (UTC) representing when this card completes the approval stage. It is not usable until this time. You can use [EpochConverter](http://www.epochconverter.com/) to decode the timestamp.
- In the sandbox environment the credit card registration delay is set to 5 minutes. The registration delay will be longer in the production environment. In both cases, the duration of the delay will be reflected in active_date. 
- For Sandbox testing you *MUST* use the test credit card number "4111111111111111", as reflected in the above example. Other fake credit card numbers and valid credit card numbers are not supported in the Sandbox environment.


### Fund a platform's account.

POST /raas/v1/cc_fund

The input object is defined by [the cc_fund JSON-Schema](cc_fund.schema.json).

Example request/response:

	> POST /raas/v1/cc_fund HTTP/1.1
	> Authorization: Basic ...
	> Host: integration-api.tangocard.com
	> Accept: */*
	> Content-Length: ...
	> Content-Type: application/json
	> 
	{
	  "customer": "CompanyA",
	  "account_identifier": "123456",
	  "amount": 100000,
	  "client_ip": "55.44.33.22",
	  "security_code": "123",
	  "cc_token": "152686945"
	}

	< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	< Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	< Content-Length: ...
	<
	{
	  "success": true,
	  "fund_id": "RF11-22222222-33",
	  "amount" : 100000
	}

Example request/response:

	> POST /raas/v1/cc_unregister HTTP/1.1
	> Authorization: Basic ...
	> Host: integration-api.tangocard.com
	> Accept: */*
	> Content-Length: ...

	{
      "success": true,
      "message": "This card is no longer present in the system."
	}



## Reward Resources


### Get the catalog of available items.

GET /raas/v1/rewards

* A negative-value "unit price" indicates that the item has a variable price. In this case the minimum and maximum fields should be consulted.
* Fixed value items also include "denomination", "currency_code", and "locale".  These values represent the face value currency, while "currency_type" relates to "unit_price"
* The "denomination" is the face value of the gift card and the "unit_price" is the cost of the gift card in USD.

Example request/response:

	> GET /raas/v1/rewards HTTP/1.1
	> Authorization: Basic C0FFEEC0FFEEC0FFEEC0FFEE
